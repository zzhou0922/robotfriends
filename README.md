# Robot Friends

Robot Friends is a project for me to familiarize myself with how to use the Create React App. I acquired fundamental knowledge about React library. 

## Project Purpose

- Understand React Components, its one-way data flow design, and React virtual Dom.
-  Figured out how CardList.js and SearchBox.js interact with each other by using their parent Component App.js.
- Smart Component, also called container,  has "state" and it tends to code with class syntax. App.js in this project is the smart component.
- Pure Components, such as CardList, SearchBox, are only accepting props. And it could code with function syntax.
- Familiar with child concept in state by having Scroll.js done. 
- Practiced how to live the website on a GitHub page by using Create React App.

## Feature

- You can search for available robot friends through the search bar. 
- The result will be filtered out immediately after you enter a character and output all available robot friends to you.
